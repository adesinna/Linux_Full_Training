man ls

File Ownership
chgrp and chown

sudo chown root:root  hlep.txt
sudo chgrp root dir


Access Control List:
    Suppose you create a file, and you want others to only read it, you can add r permission for others, however
    this will be for all the others, suppose you want to make it fine grain, then we would use access control list


    setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file


echo "shanana" | tee text.txt  # shows it and redirect

echo "shanana" | tee -a text.txt  # shows it and append

ls; ifconfig; pwd  #multi commands


less text.txt
more text.txt


cut # allows you to slice the file

sed # it is used to replace word
sed 's/oldword/newword/g' filename


useradd name

id name

userdel name

userdel -r name  # this will delete the home directory



sudo groupadd devops

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g devops shina

-m : creates home directory
-s : the shell
-g : the group


sudo passwd shina # to set password

sudo usermod -aG devops shina # adds  shina to devops group

see all the users in /etc/passwd
see all the groups in /etc/group
see all the passwords /etc/shadow

To make a a sudoer

sudo usermod -aG sudo shina

sudo usermod -aG wheel shina  # same as sudo group


# the password behavior can be modify if edit the file
/etc.login.def

last | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
last: user that have been logged in
awk: get the first column
sort: sort the users
uniq: take out duplicate


users # shows all that is logged in

wall # send messages to all logged in users

write user_name # this will send message to the user_name


Special Permissions:
setuid and setguid is to run a command on behalf of another user
passwd

chmod u+s file # if the owner sets this it would only run with the owners permission
chmod u-s
-rwsr-xr-x 1 alice devs 12345 Jul 20 12:00 myprog


chmod g+s  # group
chmod g-s
-rwr-xsr-x 1 alice devs 12345 Jul 20 12:00 myprog

Sticky ensures the own of the file can only delete it

chmod 1777 mydir   # the 1 means sticky bit
chmod +t mydir
drwxrwxrwt  10 root root 4096 Sep 5 12:00 /tmp

    Is a scheduled running of application







Systemctl
To start,stop, restart, enable, disable a service

systemctl disable kubelet.service

systemctl list-units # shows all the services

service runs in background, they come up automatically they are different from process

nproc # see the number of cpu

PS

ps aux # to see all the processes running
ps -ef
ps -u ubuntu

TOP
top # shows you the process in real time

KILL

kill pid
kill -9 pid
kill -3 pid
kill -STOP pid  #
kill -CONT pid

nohup sleep 75 # runs in the background no matter what

nice -n 10 mycommand # start a command with niceness of 10
renice -n 5 -p 12345 # assign niceness to a programm



sleep 100  and type ctrl z

bg  #background
fg  #foreground


System Monitoring:
top or htop  # to see the process consuming

df -h # to see the disk usage

sudo du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -n 10 # sort from largest

dmesg   #the errors in the system

iostat -h

free -m  # for ram
