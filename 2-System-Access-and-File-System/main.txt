Linux has a superuser called `root`, who has full administrative privileges. The kernel is the core of the operating
system that manages hardware resources, handles system calls from programs, and coordinates the execution of processes.

Access to Linux System:
    There two ways you can access your linux OS
    i. Console:
        This is like direct access to the operating system, using a cable like HDMI

    ii. Remote Access
        This is allows you to connect remotely to the machine, mostly we would be connecting remotely



Filesystem

/
This is the root directory of the linux system

/boot
This contains an important file called grub.cfg, when a system boots up it first looks for the file configurations

/dev
This contains all the devices that is connected to the system e.g printer

/etc
This contains all the configuration files

/bin
This points to /usr/bin which contains the commands that users use like ls, whoami

/sbin
This points to /usr/bin which contains the commands that system uses

/opt
This is where the optional adds on application is

/proc
This contains the running processes

/lib
This contains the C programming libraries file that commands and apps uses

/tmp
This is a temporary files directory

/var
This contains system logs

/run
This is the system daemons that start very early

/mnt
To mount external filesystem like NFS

/media
This is for cdroms




drwxr-xr-x. 2 ubuntu ubuntu 6 Sep  3 02:09 test  # the 2 stands for number of hardlinks or subdirectory


Looking for files

find . -name "shina"  # this finds the file or directory name shina


Wildcards:
rm -rf .text   # this will remove all .txt files

touch my-file{1..5} # creates file my-file1 to 5

ls -l ?xt  # it would match a single char at the beginning followed by xt
ls -l [t x] # list all that contains t or x



File Types:
d  directory:
  A folder that can contain files and other directories.

l symbolic link (link):
  A reference or pointer to another file or directory.

 character device (special file):
  Represents devices that handle data character by character (e.g., `/dev/tty` for terminals).

b block device (special file):
  Represents devices that handle data in blocks (e.g., `/dev/sda` for hard drives).

s socket:
  A special file used for inter-process communication over a network or locally.

p  pipe (FIFO):
  A special file that allows communication between processes in a first-in-first-out manner.


Hard Links and Soft Links

Every thing is stored to memory as inode

1. Files and Inodes

In Linux, every file has:

 Data: the actual content.
 Inode: a data structure storing metadata (permissions, owner, timestamps, and a pointer to the data).
 Filename: just a human-readable name pointing to the inode.

Think of it like this:


inode (real data) <--- filename1

2. Hard Link

A hard link is another filename pointing to the same inode.
Both names are equal; the file doesn’t care which name you use.
The file exists as long as at least one hard link exists.
You cannot hard link across different file systems.

Example:

bash
echo "Hello" > file1.txt
ln file1.txt file2.txt   # hard link


file1.txt and `file2.txt` point to the same inode.
 If you delete `file1.txt`, `file2.txt` still works.



3. Soft Link (Symbolic Link)

 A soft link is like a shortcut or pointer to another file by its filename.
 It has its own inode, but the content is just the path to the target file.
