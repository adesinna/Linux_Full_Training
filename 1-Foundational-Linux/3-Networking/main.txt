Network Basics
Suppose we have two computers and, they need to talk to each other, A and B can be connected to the same network, however
how ?
There is an interface on each computer and they are connected physically or virtually to a switch that would now create
a network.

Now suppose we have switch A and switch B, creating two different network, to let them be able to talk to each other
we use a router. Since the route is just a device, you must configure a nat gateway to point to the router.

Cannot reach a site on your host?

1. ip link
This will check whether the interface is up

2. Let us check whether is it resolving
    nslookup hostname

3. ping server
    ping hostname

4. traceroute hostname

5. netstat -tulpn or ss -tupln
On the server

6. ip link
on the server
