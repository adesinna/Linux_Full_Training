1. DAS: Direct Attached Storage
This is the simplest form of storage. It is physically connected to a single computer or server, usually via a USB cable
or a SATA/SAS drive inside the machine.

Analogy: A personal backpack. Only you can access it, and you have to be physically holding it to get your stuff.

Pros: Fast, inexpensive, and incredibly easy to set up.

Cons: Not shareable. If you want someone else to see the data, you have to move the whole drive or set up a software share.

2. NAS: Network Attached Storage
NAS is a dedicated device with its own IP address that sits on your local network (LAN). It operates at the file level,
meaning it manages files and folders just like your computer’s OS does.


Analogy: A shared filing cabinet in an office hallway. Anyone with permission can walk up and grab a folder.

Pros: Great for collaboration, easy file sharing, and provides a central location for backups.

Cons: Can be slower than DAS because data has to travel over the Ethernet network, which can get congested.

3. SAN: Storage Area Network
A SAN is a high-speed, specialized network that connects servers to "pools" of storage. Unlike NAS, it operates at the
block level. To a server, a SAN doesn't look like a network drive; it looks like a local physical hard drive.

Analogy: A city-sized warehouse. It’s complex and requires specialized transport (Fibre Channel), but it can handle
massive amounts of data with extreme efficiency.

Pros: High performance, highly scalable, and no single point of failure.

Cons: Very expensive and requires a specialized IT team to manage.
