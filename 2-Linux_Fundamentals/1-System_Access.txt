There are two ways you can access a linux system

1. Console
    This is when there is  direct access to the operating system when it is
    connected through VGA, HDMI, DVI


2. Remote
    This is when you connect to your operating system remotely over a network
    For example RDP allows you to connect to another window desktop over the internet
    while for macOS sharing.
    To connect to linux from a window machine you can use putty, ssh can also
    connect using ssh


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-8-239 ~]$
user@hostname ~(home) $/#  $ for normal user and # for root user
[root@ip-172-31-8-239 ~]#

To know the hostname:
    hostname

To know the user:
    whoami

To get details:
    hostnamectl
